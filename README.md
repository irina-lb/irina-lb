# 👋 Hi, my name is Irina and I'm glad to see you here!!
#### I'm a web developer from Russia :ru: , but currently living in Malaga, Spain :es:.

##### Here are some facts about me:

- :star_struck: I just finished my first full stack project. You can check it __[here](https://github.com/irina-lb/Full-Stack-Project)__.
- :headphones: I'm listening music for inspiration and to write some code. (I recommend this __[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A)__, if you also do!) 
- :open_book: I'm reading daily, not only books, but also documentation.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I also have an economics degree, but I have never worked in this field. (But I'm grateful for this experience, it helps me in my life and work.)
- 💞️ I love this huge digital world and I'm sure this is exactly where I want to be!
- 👀 Now I'm looking for new projects and working opportunities.

#### Languages and technology being lerned:
